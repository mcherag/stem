              <p> STEM and Coding are important because technology & computers are everywhere. Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. Most people know how to use technology, but most people don’t know how to create or invent new
                things with technology. Being able to create new things with technology is one of the most important skills in the world today.
                In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 55 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We
                know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge. </p>

              <p>
              <p> The idea and vision behind STEM Coding School is that Computer Science aka ‘Coding’ is the most in-demand skill of the 21st century, as it is a blend of all the STEM categories (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math).
                The current education system is not aligned to the needs of the Software Industry. Students have no place to go and bridge this huge gap. There is an enormous opportunity to update the curriculum of the world schools and in the last
                three years there's been an unbelievable unprecedented movement led by governments of developed nations. They have declared computer science “A National Necessity” and made it part of their national curriculum by changing their
                education policies to embrace computer science. This prompted me to address </p>

              <p>this very real need of the students in the Indian rural & urban community. </p>

              <p>STEM Coding School was started as a learning center to teach young people code early, starting 5 years old with learning-by-doing to build confidence and unlock their creativity, communication, critical thinking, collaboration &
                computational thinking.
                The courses here are designed to help students with their curriculum and give them the feel of the Software industry. There is no restriction on the age to start coding, whether you are a student completing your matriculation or just
                started going to school or a working professional planning to switch domain to Software/IT or probably enhance your Coding skills, I would like to welcome you to join STEM Coding School.</p>

              <p>STEM Coding School is preparing the student community whether rural or urban to meet demands and opportunities of the 21st century, as coding would be a required language, regardless what career students want to pursue in
                STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) & Art professions which will help them to manage all spheres of life, whether Social, Cultural or Economical.
                We teach young people to code early, starting 5 years old with learning-by-doing to build confidence and unlock their creativity,
                communication, critical thinking, collaboration & computational thinking. Learning to program computers, robots, drones etc. will also make them extremely cool!
                We build skills like analytical thinking, reasoning
                Develop problem solving skills such as perseverance, trial & error Better career options
                Coding challenges children to think creatively & pursue innovative solutions
                Coding encompasses, correlates and creates an ecosystem to
                enhance and sustain STEM - </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Science</li>
                <li>Technology</li>
                <li>Engineering</li>
                <li>Mathematics</li>
              </ul>

              <p>We develop these skills in students by teaching them in classrooms and on research developed tools by MIT Media Lab: as well as take guidance and support from international education communities.

                We also teach them industry standard programming languages such as Swift, C, C++, Java and Python which augment their Sr. Secondary School curriculum also.

                STEM Coding School is currently offering four levels of interactive classroom courses for students in grades K - 12: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced & Pro </p>

              <p> The reality is that computer science is about logic, problem solving, and creativity. It teaches students how to think differently about problems they are trying to solve in any context. It teaches kids how to create digital
                artifacts and how those artifacts impact the world around them by looking at issues such as privacy and security.
                A very simple way to think about this is CS teaches kids how to CREATE new technologies instead of just being consumers of technology.
                Just as important as recognizing what computer science is, is
                recognizing what it is not</p>

                <li>It is not basic HTML design</li>

                <p>The main reason that computer science is now foundational knowledge necessary in every school is because it will allow students to think about problems differently. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Right now there’s no expectation in our schools that students will even have a basic understanding of these concepts, even though they are driving a large part of our society.</li>
                  <li>It is equally important that students understand what a “for loop” is and how it is used and how to design algorithms is as it is that they understand how to solve an equation or how plants live</li>
                  <li>Students will gain computational thinking skills, which embody a more robust way to think about problems</li>
                  <li>And the problem-solving process can be applied to any field of study and to any problem</li>
                  <li>If you are facing a big, ambiguous project at home or at work, computational thinking and problem-solving processes can help you break this problem into smaller chunks. Recognizing what’s important and what needs to be solved
                    first are critical thinking skills that are valuable in ANY context</li>
                  <li>Education today has numerous controversial topics, but computer science isn’t one of them. At a time that we are fighting about what should or shouldn’t be taught in our schools, 90% of parents are asking for computer science in
                    their schools</li>
                  <li>What we need now is schools to put two things into place:</li>
                  <li>First, high-quality, rigorous curriculum and courses</li>
                  <li>Second, we need to prepare teachers to teach our students We need govt. to launch initiatives build on these two goals and focused on improving access to CS education</li>

                <p>It is important for everyone to understand the basics. Studying these disciplines gives people computational thinking, critical thinking (Analysis of facts to make judgement) and problem-solving skills that are used in
                  non-technology areas as well. Knowing how to approach complex problems, break down the challenges into small pieces and approach resolving them in a logical manner are critical skills in all industries. </p>

                <p>The reality of our education system today is that it is not set up for everyone to participate in the new economy and opportunity. Computer science isn’t widely taught in our schools. A recently released comprehensive Gallup survey
                  of parents and school administrators shows the stark gap between what parents want and what is happening in our schools, 9 out of 10 parents surveyed WANT their child to learn computer science. But according to our Access Report,
                  just 45% of high schools teach computer science courses Our education system clearly needs to evolve to bring computer science to students that want to learn this subject. And this evolution isn’t something the tech industry wants,
                  it is clearly something that parents and students want.</p>

                <p>Coding is an important TOOL for computer science but it is a bit like arithmetic is a TOOL for doing mathematics, and words are a TOOL for English. Coding creates software, but computer science is a broad field encompassing deep
                  concepts that go well beyond coding. And all students should have access to computer science courses in their schools. </p>
